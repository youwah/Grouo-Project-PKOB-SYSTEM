## Introduction
Natural disasters are major adverse events caused by the natural processes of the earth, including floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other geological processes. In Kedah, the most frequent natural disasters are floods. Floods in Kedah are mainly caused by flash floods due to the high-intensity rainfall in a short period, water surges, and overflowing rivers. Heavy rains also caused stagnation in some areas, causing flooding. Recently, Kedah has experienced two unexpected floods in a short period of time. 

The most recent flood occurred in Yan, Kedah, facing a flash flood from the foothills of Gunung Jerai. The flash flood occurred on Wednesday, August 18, 2021, at 5:30 pm in Malaysia. The heavy downpour caused gushes and landslides on Gunung Jerai, and later caused muddy flash floods in the Yan, Kuala Muda, and Baharu areas of Kedah. The area surrounding Gunung Jerai Resort was severely damaged. The difficulty of accessing the road from the affected flash flood site has hindered the search and rescue of the casualties who are believed to have drowned and were washed away by strong currents. The flash flood affected about 879 families (4,395 people) in the disaster area in Yan district and 86 families (430 people) in Kubang Pasu district. The data collected is based on the Yan and Kuala Muda regional office as of August 22, 2021. 

On August 19, 2021, the Kedah state government has declared the area along the river Kuala Muda as a level 1 disaster area in accordance with the No. 20 Directive of the National Security Council (NSC). 

After two accidental flash floods occurred in a short period of time, flash flood victims in Yan Kedah called for a more effective disaster management system. In this case, this project is to develop a Pusat Kawalan Operasi Bencana (PKOB) system with Telegram Bot and Web Application using Python programming language to help Penghulu Mukim Bujang Kota / Mukim Rantau Panjang, Encik Hamdan bin Yahaya. This system can store the data of the affected disaster victims, their relevant family details, and the type of assistance that is applied by the disaster victims. This enables disaster victims and village chiefs to communicate with each other and manage immediate assistance via telegram bot and web application in real time. It is easy to access, search, use, copy, modify, save and keep it safe. This approach is more effective because it allows us to store large amounts of data in less space than paper. It is also easy to make a backup copy without taking up a lot of extra space.

The problem statement is Penghulu still uses the unsystematic method of collecting and recording data of disaster victims such as lengthy procedures before applying for assistance and paper-based records.

The goal of this project is to develop Pusat Kawalan Operasi Bencana (PKOB) system with Telegram Bot and Web Application. In order to archive the goal,there are 4 objectives which are to analyse the requirements for a web-based system named Pusat Kawalan Operasi Bencana(PKOB), to design a web-based system named PKOB to record and disseminate report, to develop a web-based system named PKOB to record and disseminate report, and to evaluate a web-based system named PKOB to record and disseminate report.

The project scope is to develop the Pusat Kawalan Operasi Bencana (PKOB) system. This system is developed for the victims that suffered from disaster in the village Mukim Bujang Merbok, Kedah, who face problems such as damage to properties or deterioration of health conditions. The system users include disasters victims who can make an application for material or financial assistance to get goods or funding through the PKOB web system and the Penghulu Kampung who manages the name list and distribution welfare through the system.

The significance of the project is to have an impact on the community. When disasters happen in a certain area, the community of that area would like to get help as fast as possible. But, the same procedure needs to be done before getting welfare and it will take some time. Pusat Kawalan Operasi Bencana (PKOB) is a project system established to assist the area of the community which has been affected by disasters. PKOB operated in handling the welfare of the community and carrying it out to needed community areas.

The community areas that have been affected by the disasters will face the problem of getting welfare as fast as possible. So, the PKOB system could assist them to check their availability and claim welfare simply and more easily. In conclusion, the PKOB system brought a lot of benefits and convenience to the community.

The methodology that will be utilized for developing Pusat Kawalan Operasi Bencana (PKOB) system is Rapid Application Development (RAD). RAD is an agile project management approach popular in software development. The main advantage of a RAD approach is quick project turnaround which makes it an attractive alternative for developers working in a fast-paced environment like software development. By eliminating planning time and emphasizing prototype iterations, RAD enables project managers and stakeholders to efficiently monitor progress and communicate in real-time on growing issues or changes. The phases of developing a system application with RAD include requirement planning, user design, rapid construction, and cutover.

## Problem Statement
Villagers near Mukim Bujang Merbok, Kedah, are dealing with heavy floods, particularly during downpours. However, due to the lack of a systematic application, the process of reaching out to the flood-affected communities to assist them in resolving their needs is delayed. Currently, they use a non-systematic method to collect and record the data. Disaster victims need to go through lengthy and unnecessary procedures before applying for assistance. The village chief is doing repetitive work, causing some victims to receive assistance repeatedly. This not only leads to a decrease in efficiency, but also causes multiple problems in miscommunication. For example, disaster victims need to go to the village chief's office to make a record when they encounter problems, which leads to crowded and chaotic situations. The village chief has to understand the problems faced by each person and record them repeatedly even if most of the problems are the same.

The recording method of the village chief still uses the traditional method which is hard copy records. This method is unorganized and has caused many shortcomings such as insufficient storage space, easy damage, time-wasting, high cost, increased administrative work, difficulty in making changes, lack of security, and inaccurate records. When a disaster occurs, a large amount of data needs to be stored. The village chief stores the information on paper, it will start to take up a lot of space. As he continues to accumulate paper, something will happen. Storage costs have risen, the files that are looking for are more difficult to find, and files take up more and more space. In addition, paper documents are easily damaged, and you may lose years of records in the event of a fire or flood. As for security issues, misplaced documents can easily be placed in the wrong hands. In this case, a well-organized system can prevent unnecessary loss of records and facilitate online storage of data. Therefore, disaster victims and other authorities such as village chief can access the system through the system at any time. 

This group project is to develop a program named Pusat Kawalan Operasi Bencana (PKOB) with Telegram Bot and Web Application using Python programming language. This enables disaster victims and village chiefs to communicate with each other and manage immediate assistance via telegram bot and web application in real time.  Village chief also can store data in PKOB, it is easy to access, search, use, copy, modify, save and keep it safe. This approach is more effective because it allows us to store large amounts of data in less space than paper. It is also easy to make a backup copy without taking up a lot of extra space.

## Objectives
1. To analyse the requirements for a web-based system named Pusat Kawalan Operasi Bencana(PKOB).
2. To design a web-based system named Pusat Kawalan Operasi Bencana(PKOB) to record and disseminate report. 
3. To develop a web-based system named Pusat Kawalan Operasi Bencana(PKOB) to record and disseminate report. 
4. To evaluate a web-based system named Pusat Kawalan Operasi Bencana(PKOB) to record and disseminate report. 

## Project Scope
Pusat Kawalan Operasi Bencana (PKOB) system is developed for the victims that suffered from  disaster in the village Mukim Bujang Merbok, Kedah, who face problems such as damage to properties or deterioration of health conditions. The system users include disasters victims who can make an application for material or financial assistance to get goods or funding through the PKOB web system and the Penghulu Kampung who manages the name list and distribution welfare through the system.

## Project Significance (Impact to Community)
When disasters happen in a certain area, the community of that area would like to get help as fast as possible. But, there is some procedure that needs to be done before getting welfare and it will take some time. Pusat Kawalan Operasi Bencana (PKOB) is a project system established to assist the area of the community which has been affected by disasters. PKOB operated in handling the welfare of the community and carrying it out to needed community areas.  

The community areas that have been affected by the disasters will face the problem of getting welfare as fast as possible. So, the PKOB system could assist them to check their availability and claim welfare in a simple and easier way.  In conclusion, the PKOB system brought a lot of benefits and convenience to the community.

## Project Methodology
The methodology that will be utilised for developing Pusat Kawalan Operasi Bencana (PKOB) system is Rapid Application Development (RAD). RAD is an agile project management approach popular in software development. The main advantage of a RAD approach is quick project turnaround which makes it an attractive alternative for developers working in a fast-paced environment like software development. By eliminating planning time and emphasising prototype iterations, RAD enables project managers and stakeholders to efficiently monitor progress and communicate in real time on growing issues or changes. The RAD approach will be able to both expedite system development and improve software quality. In addition, RAD approach able to break the project down into smaller and more manageable tasks. The task-oriented structure allows team leader to optimize their team’s efficiency by assigning tasks according to members’ specialties and experience. Clients can get a working product delivered in a shorter time frame. Regular communication and feedback between team members and stakeholders improves the design and construction process's efficiency. This approach was appropriate for small to medium-sized software development projects. With a shorter planning phase and an emphasis on highly iterative design and construction, teams that use RAD to develop systems can achieve more in less time while maintaining client satisfaction. The phases of developing a system application with RAD include requirement planning, user design, rapid construction, and cutover. The phases involved are as shown in figure below:

**1. Requirements Planning**

This project aims to develop a Pusat Kawalan Operasi Bencana (PKOB) system. During this phase, the expected functionality of the Pusat Kawalan Operasi Bencana (PKOB) system will be gathered. The requirement will be gathered through interview method from respective user. In this phase, the discussion between developer and supervisor has been done to plan and determine the project requirement.


**2. User Design**

The project's development can be begin as soon as the initial requirements have been gathered and finalized. There will be several types of prototypes with different features and functions developed by following the requirements in this phase.

**3. Construction**

This project construction phase is all about coding, testing, and debugging the software. During this phase is the most in-depth and complicated work of the project since all of the functions and processes of the system depend on it. Its purpose is to implement the requirements from the design phase in the software. Developer has decided to use PyCharm for creating the functions of the system, especially for implementing and debugging the codes so that the system works as planned. 

**4. Cutover**

This is the phase when the final work is ready to be released. The project will be evaluated to test the PKOB system stability and usability by the respective user to identify whether this project's objective, goal, and requirement are fulfilled. The user will be instructed on how to use the system and to test the PKOB system. The feedback will be gathered and analysed so that the developer can optimize the system. Once the system is improved and passed the evaluation, it is ready to be released.

## Project Limitation
In our concept, there is no project limitation in the system that have been developed. All of the function is functioning well in the system.
## Conclusion
The PKOB web-based system has been successfully developed and as well as the telegram bot. All of the system has already deployed to heroku and is running online 24/7. This system could help Tok Penghulu to manage victims' details easily in a systematic way. With the PKOB system, Tok Penghulu are able to view the information and amount of victims, view the request that registered as a victim, add victims and view the victims that have received help kits in a report. Tok penghulu can also do some action in each of the functions for example delete, edit, approve, decline or receive. All this data will also be able to be viewed in the dashboard of our website. Other than that, the telegram bot that has been created is able to let Tok Penghulu check victim information where they are requested, registered or received help kits without navigating into the website. Tok Penghulu is able to check all these details anytime anywhere with a smartphone and telegram. In a nutshell, we hope that this system can help Tok Penghulu to manage the victims in a more easier way.
